## 📚 Efficient Learning Approach (Best Practice ✅)

### 🔁 Learn Structure + Algorithm Together (Not Separately)

### 🧭 Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Understand the Data Structure**
   - What it stores, how it works
   - Real-world analogy and core operations (insert, delete, search)

2. **Learn Key Algorithms Associated**
   - Learn the logic
   - Dry-run examples on paper or whiteboard

3. **Code the DS + Algorithms**
   - Implement both from scratch once or twice
   - Practice variations (e.g., sorting using recursion or heap)

4. **Solve Real Problems**
   - Start with Easy → Medium (Leetcode, GFG, Codeforces)
   - Try pattern-based learning (e.g., Sliding Window, Two Pointer)

5. **Apply & Revisit When Needed**
   - Use it in ML, Games, Web Apps, or Competitive Challenges

## 🎯 Minimal DSA for ML/AI Developers

Focus only on these topics if you’re learning ML and not preparing for job interviews:

- ✅ Arrays & Strings
- ✅ HashMaps
- ✅ Sliding Window + Two Pointers
- ✅ Recursion (basic)
- ✅ Stack & Queue
- ✅ Basic Tree & Graph (DFS/BFS only)

## 🧠 Tip:
> Algorithms and Data Structures are **partners**. Learn them **in context**, not isolation.
